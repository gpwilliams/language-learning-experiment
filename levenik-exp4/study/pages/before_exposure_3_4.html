			<h1>Word Learning</h1>
			<p>You will notice that people from different areas speak the language in slightly different ways - you probably know that this happens in many countries like Britain, for example. In this case, the people from the coast speak slightly differently than the people inland. You will see little pictures, like the one below, that lets you know where a speaker is coming from. </p>	
			<p>On the next few screens you will hear all of the words in our language and be asked to repeat them aloud into your microphone. You will hear each word again after recording.</p>
			<p>This first speaker you will hear comes from the region illustrated below.</p>
			<img id="locationPicture" src="">
			<p>Please check that your microphone is plugged in and switched on, and that you are wearing headphones or have speakers turned on throughout. </p>
