			<h1>Reading Practice Block</h1>
			<p>Normally, there are 3 practice blocks and in this study, however in the interest of brevity we only provide you with one practice block in this demonstration.
			</p><p>Next, you will see the words spelled out using the made-up letters. Read them out loud from left to right as best as you can. Make sure your microphone and speakers/headphones are working and press RECORD once you are ready to speak - <b>you only get one chance at recording each word so make sure you know what to say before clicking RECORD</b>. Once you have recorded yourself, you will hear how the word should sound.
			</p><p>This may seem difficult at first and you may feel like you canâ€™t remember any of the letter sounds. But rest assured, we know based on the experience of others that you will get better pretty quickly.
