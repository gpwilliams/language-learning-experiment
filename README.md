# language-learning-experiment
Source code for the Artificial Language Learning Experiment by Williams, Panayotov, &amp; Kempe.

This experiment is used in two papers which explore the effect of dialect exposure on literacy acquisition.

**Paper one**: How Does Dialect Exposure Affect Learning to Read and Spell? An Artificial Orthography Study. \[[PsyArXiv preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/b8zn6/), [peer-reviewed article](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0000778), [data and analysis code](https://github.com/gpwilliams/levenik), [OSF project](https://osf.io/5mtdj/)\].
