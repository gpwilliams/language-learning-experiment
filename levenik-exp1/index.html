			<h1>Welcome to our 'Made-up Language Learning'-study!</h1>
			<p>We are trying to understand what factors make it easier or more difficult to learn to read. Because adults already know how to read in one or several languages, we made up a language of our own to study how people do it.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>First, you will hear the words of our language.
			</li>
			<li>Then you will see some invented letters and hear their sounds.
			</li><li>Then you will see words written using these letters and will learn to read them out loud. This is when we need to record you using your microphone.
			</li><li>At the end, you will read the words again and we will see what you have learned.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You will be trained to read in our made-up language over 6 training blocks.</p>
			<p>On average, we estimate this task to take around 50 minutes to complete. Feel free to take breaks between sections.</p>
			<p>Please make sure that you are in a quiet environment prior to taking part in this study, as we need good quality voice recordings.</p>
			</p><p>For this, we would ask you to have a microphone and speakers/headphones ready and plugged in. Please check they are working before taking part. This study is not compatible with iPhones and iPads, as well as the Safari browser and Internet Explorer, because of restrictions on audio recording. Please use the latest version of Google Chrome for best results.
			</p>
			<p>If you experience any technical difficulties during the study try refreshing or reloading the page through your browser.</p>
			<p><b>You are not allowed to write things down on paper as that is considered cheating! You shouldn't try it as it is very easy for us to tell when someone cheats.</b></p>
			<br>
			<div id="noMicMessage"><p><em>You either do not have a microphone plugged in or you have not granted us permission to use it. You cannot continue unless we can record you - please make sure you allow microphone use in your browser and refresh or reload the page.</em></p></div>
			<div id="noBrowserMessage" hidden><p><em>Your browser does not support audio recording and so you cannot participate through this browser.</em></p></div>
			<div id="noAudioMessage" hidden><p><em>Your browser does not support audio elements and so you cannot participate through this browser.</em></p></div>
