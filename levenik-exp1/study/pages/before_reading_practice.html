			<h1>Reading Practice Block</h1>
			<p>Next, you will see some of the words spelled out using the made-up letters. Read them out loud from left to right as best as you can. Make sure your microphone and speakers/headphones are working and press RECORD once you are ready to speak - <b>you only get one chance at recording each word so make sure you know what to say before clicking RECORD</b>. Once you have recorded yourself, you will hear how the word should sound.
			</p><p>This may seem difficult at first and you may feel like you can’t remember any of the letter sounds. But rest assured, we know based on the experience of others that you will get better pretty quickly.
			</p><p>Bear in mind that there are in total 6 reading practice blocks in this study.</p>
			<p>You may take a short break if you like. Please don’t stay away for too long or you will forget what you have just learned.</p>
